# Multi-Instance Minecraft (MIMC)

## Introduction
MIMC modifies Paperclip and Waterfall to allow Minecraft to run one world with multiple instances.

## Getting started 

    git clone https://github.com/Malfrador/Prismarine/Prismarine.git
	cd mimc
	
	In case of using linux use this command to make the file executable:
	chmod +x ./setup.sh
	
    ./setup.sh
This will build & run the server to create necessary files. Once it's completed ```stop``` the server and `Ctrl + C` to continue the setup.
## Running the servers

    ./start_waterfall.sh
	./start_node_spawn.sh
	./start_node_child.sh

## Updating your local repository with current changes

	git pull -ff-only

	In case of using linux use this command to make the file executable:
